    "The accuracy of the computed solution $\\hat{x}$ of the system of linear equations $Ax=b$ can sometimes be improved by a process called iterative refinement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve $Ax = b$ with GE to get $\\hat{x}$ the estimate for $x$. You will find helpful functions in Assignment 2 which has answers in the Exercises folder.\n",
    "2. Compute the residual $r = b - A\\hat{x}$\n",
    "3. Solve $Ad = r$ to get $d$\n",
    "4. Update $\\hat{x}$ by adding $d$ to $\\hat{x}$.     ( $\\hat{x} \\leftarrow \\hat{x} + d$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 2--4 are repeated until there is convergence to a more accurate solution. At each iteration, since the matrices $L$, $U$ have already been computed when solving $Ax=b$, they can be used to solve $Ad=r$ in two stages using FS and BS at a cost of $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `GE_ref`, based on your function `GE`, to compute a solution to $Ax=b$ using GE with iterative refinement. Investigate the performance of `GE_ref` compared to that of `GE` and `GEPP`\n",
    "You may wish to use test cases of  the  different values of $n$ and random matrices as in Assignment 2 and/or test methods from the Jupyter notebook in Week 2 called  _QR Methods Demo_ which investigates the effect of different condition numbers $\\kappa_2(A)$. You should look at times taken, errors and residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "Your results should be well presented (with some graphs if possible in the time that you have) and a **comment must be made** on your observations. You decide on what investigations you can do in the time available. If you are a faster programmer you can do a greater variety of tests. This is an open-ended task just like a research investigation would be. We look forward to what you will find and tell us.\n",
